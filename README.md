# Uber Clone with Enhanced Features

This project is an Uber clone application that includes several unique features beyond the standard ride-hailing service, such as a "Quiet Mode" for riders and the option to donate rides to NGO beneficiaries.

## Features

* **Standard Ride Booking:** Users can book rides by selecting their pickup and drop-off locations.
* **Multiple Vehicle Options:** Offers different ride categories (e.g., Uber Go, Auto, Uber XL) with varying prices.
* **Prefer a Quiet Ride:** Riders have the option to request a quiet journey, minimizing conversation and distractions during the ride.
* **Donate a Ride (User Side):** Users can choose to donate their ride to an NGO person if the route is suitable. When this option is selected, details of a potential NGO ride request matching the user's route are displayed. Upon accepting, the user is prompted to enter an NGO-provided OTP to verify and confirm the donation. A success message confirms the verification.
* **Donate a Ride (NGO Side):** NGOs have an interface to submit their ride requests, specifying details like pickup and drop-off locations. Once requested, the system indicates that the request is being sent to nearby potential donors. When a donor accepts the request, the NGO is notified and provided with an OTP to share with the donor. After the ride is completed and verified, the NGO receives a confirmation message.
* **Ride Confirmation:** After finalizing the request, a summary of the selected ride options is displayed.
* **User Profile & Account Management:** Includes standard user account options (Help, Wallet, Activity, Manage account, Promotions).
* **Demo Feature: NGO Account Switching:** For demonstration purposes, there is an option to switch to an NGO view directly from the user profile. *(Note: In a production application, interaction with NGOs might be handled through a separate interface or system.)*
